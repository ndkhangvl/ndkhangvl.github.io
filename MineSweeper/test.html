<p>

<li>
You are a Product Manager and you want to share a certain folder, called 
ProjectX, 
with
your team members with whom you share a defined user group on a UNIX 
system. 
These files are management-level sensitive documents that the entire 
group 
needs to work on the project. As such, you want to share them in such a 
way 
that the group has
read-only access to the files, and everyone else has no access.  Because 
some documents
were created by previous managers before you arrived, you don't have
ownership of all of the files.
<p>

Using the numeric representation of permissions, write a command that 
will
allow you to perform this operation on the ProjectX directory that 
resides
in /org/projects/ProjectX.  Keep in mind that <i>you do not own all of 
the files</i>.
