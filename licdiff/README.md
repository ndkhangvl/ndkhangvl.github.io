# Licence Differentiator

This tool attempts to help its users understand their own preferences in relation to free and open source software licences. It is no substitute for reading the licences themselves, and before placing any of your property under one of these licences, it is essential that you fully read and understand your chosen licence. The classifications of licence type that enable this tool to work are by necessity somewhat reductive, and therefore output of this tool cannot and must not be thought of as legal advice.

A live version of this tool can be found on the [OSS Watch website](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/licdiff)

The code was originally written by Sander van der Waal with licence definitions by Rowan Wilson
